## Big Decimals

Imagine that you've been tasked with creating a payment system for a local subway.

Riders use a card system where they can add money to their card and then use this balance to pay for their subway rides. Your task is to create a model for this system 

ensuring precision when dealing with currency amounts.

- Rider Card: Consider how you would represent a rider's card. What information does it need to store? How would you add money to the card, or pay for a ride? Remember to handle money with precision in all calculations.

- Subway Fare: Now, think about the subway's fare system.
- Subway System: Finally, consider how you would put these pieces together. How does a rider use their card to pay for rides on the subway? What happens if the rider does not have enough balance on their card for a ride?
